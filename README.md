This script is made of crutches, but should fix the problem with the IPhone 8 disabling WiFi distribution.
IPhone 8 is constantly trying to save charge and as soon as it sees that there is no traffic and the internet is being used, it immediately disconnects WiFi.
The essence of this script is that by connecting to the broadcast of online radio, will create a constant and minimal traffic, which should solve the problem.
